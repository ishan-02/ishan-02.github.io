              <h3>Bowing the Seeds</h3>
              <p id="heading-content">
                In <b>1943</b>, <b>Warren McCullough</b> and <b>Walter Pitts</b> invented <b>Artificial Neurons</b>. An artificial neuron is a mathematical function conceived 
                as a model of biological neurons, a neural network. Artificial neurons are elementary units in an artificial neural network. 
                The artificial neuron receives one or more inputs and sums them to produce an output. They understood how the brain works and found
                out that brain consists of various cells connected together called "neurons". So in their artificial model they tried to create
                these neurons and now we call them artificial neurons.

                  Artificial Neurons are similar in function to the neurons in our brains.

              <h3 style="margin-top: 30px">The Turing Test</h3>
              <p id="heading-content">
                The Turing test, originally called the imitation game by Alan Turing in 1950, is a test of a machine's ability to exhibit 
                intelligent behaviour equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human. <br>
                In his paper, Turing proposed a twist on what is called “The Imitation Game.” The Imitation Game involves no use of AI, 
                but rather three human participants in three separate rooms. Each room is connected via a screen and keyboard, one 
                containing a male, the other a female, and the other containing a male or female judge. The female tries to convince the 
                judge that she is the male, and the judge tries to disseminate which is which. 

                <p style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%; font-size: 20px;" id="games">
                  Turing changes the concept of this game to include an AI, a human and a human questioner. The questioner’s job is then to decide which is the AI and which is the human. Science the formation of the test, many AI have been able to pass; one of the first is a program created by Joseph Weizenbaum called ELIZA.

              <h3 style="margin-top: 30px">Games</h3>
              <p id="heading-content">
                From 1951 AI was used in games and it was common to say that AI machines cheated to keep up with human players at that time.
                But now AI machines don't cheat, as they have become better than their ancestors so there is no need to cheat to keep up with human players.

              <h3>Birth Of AI</h3>
              <p id="heading-content">
                In 1955 <strong>John McCarth</strong> came up with an idea to organize a workshop develop ideas about 'thinking machines', he named them
                "Artificial Intelligence" , this workshop was held in 1956 in which AI was born, the workshop ran for 6 weeks.

              <h3 id="algLR">The Algorithm of Logical Reasoning</h3>
              <p id="heading-content">
                John Alan Robinson was a philosopher, mathematician and computer scientist. In 1965 he developed an algorithm for logical reasoning.
                His unification algorithm eliminated one source of combinatorial explosion in resolution provers; it also prepared the 
                ground for the logic programming paradigm, in particular for the Prolog language. Robinson received the 1996 Herbrand 
                Award for Distinguished Contributions to Automated reasoning.

              <h3 id="aiWinter">AI WINTERS</h3>
              <p id="heading-content">
                AI winters were the time periods when there was a lack of interest in AI researchs and the the ones who wanted to do it
                faced serious shortage of funding from the government, in other words it was a time period when there was no progress
                in AI researchs.<br>
                There were two major winters: 1.) From 1974 to 1980 and 2.) From 1987 to 1993
              </p>
              <h3>What Now?</h3>
              <p id="heading-content">
                Nowadays AI is being used in various almost uncountable places, from homes to offices to space stations , satellites and a lot more!
